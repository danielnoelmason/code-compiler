# Code Compiler Sanity Checker

## Description
In this project, I created a simple compile time sanity checker using Java. The sanity checker parses an input program written in “weeJava” and finds its compile time errors, similarly to what Eclipse does for you. weeJava is a subset of Java programming language (see the weeJava specification document). You can compare the result from your checker with Eclipse.

The files suffixed with 'Example' are fed to their respective java files to be processed. 

The aim of each compiler can be seen in the CSC1025_ICW.pdf
